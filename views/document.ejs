      <h3 style="color: #14e664;"> Introduction </h3>
      <p style="margin-right: 40px;">
        Welcome to FinDev, the FindDev API! This documentation should help you familiarise yourself with the resources
        available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. If you're after a native helper library then I suggest you scroll
        down and check out what's available. Read through the getting started section before you dive in. Most of your problems
        should be solved just by reading through it.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #14e664;"> What to Know </h3>
      <p >
        This application is comprised of three main web pages, they include the home page, about page and documentation page <br>
        The Home page is where most of the actions takes place, i.e. it offers functionalities for users to choose from a dropdown menu the httpMethod
        they want to use, a text area to enter information for more advanced searches, a send button and a text area that displays data based on the
        http method one choses from the drop down menu. <br>
        The About Page describes the general functionalities of this web app, technologies used as well as the contributors of this amazing
        web app. <br>
        The Documentation page offer finer details on how to navigate the application, what http method to use and how and where to use it as well 
        as general description of this project.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #14e664;">Getting started</h3>
      <p>
        Let's make our first API request to the FindDev API! <br>
        Type on your browser the url to the main page <b> https://finddev.com/api/</b>. <br>
        This will display a page with a text area where information of all developer within our system will be displayed.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #14e664;">GET Request</h3>
      <p>
        GET request are of two types in this case; <br>
        You can perform a get request for all Developers, which is the default http method when one visits the home page 
        You can also perform a GET request based on a particular ID. Once you enter the ID of a developer you want to
        search, click the send button and this will query the database for that particlar ID and sends back a response
        of that particular ID. The response will be displayed on the text area.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #14e664;">POST Request</h3>
      <p>
        This enables one to add data to the API; <br>
        When POST method is selected from the drop down, a pop up form will appear on the screen. This will prompt the user to enter his/her 
        data and upon clicking submit, the form will disapper and the data will be sent to the Database. The page will then refresh with the home
        page being displayed and one can scroll the text area to view the posted data.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #14e664;">DELETE Request</h3>
      <p>
        The delete method remove a developer permanently from the Database.  <br>
        Just like erasing one's contact from your phone, when you select DELETE from the http methods dropdown menu, you will be required to
        provide the ID of a Developer you want to delete, failure to which an alert will pop up on the screen prompting you to enter the ID
        you want to perform DELETE operation on.
        Once the ID is provided, continue by clicking the send button and once the operation is complete, a pop up will appear on the screen with a
        success message. This means that the data has been successfully erased from the Database.
